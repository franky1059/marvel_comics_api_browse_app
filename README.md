# marvel_comics_api_browse_app

This was one of the first coding exercises I did when I was at marvel. It's a small app built on Zend Framework 2 that browses their comics api. It's still live here - http://marvel.frank-myers.com/marvel. The complete project description is here - https://github.com/franky1059/marvel_comics_api_browse_app/blob/master/marvel-zend-app/README_frank_myers.txt
